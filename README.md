# Cruncher
This library takes a string such as `"x + 2 / 3 * ( z ^ 4 )"` and allows you to pass in a dictionary with values defined for each variable used and get the result.

Right now the tests do the best job of providing examples of how to interact with the library.

It is a work in progress but the main functionality is there. The lexer/parser needs to be improved as it is sensitive to spacing.
